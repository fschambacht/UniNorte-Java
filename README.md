### (reader of quality water level in Atlantic)

this challenge is about a scenario where a country has a global objective to poorly eradicate and protect the planet working with access to potable water 

the main propose is design a device to analyze the quality water, this device checks the quality of water and then the device gives the risk index of water (IRCA) and according to this result the device indicate the risk level


| Clasification IRCA (%)  |  Risk Level | 
| ------------ | ------------ | 
| 80.1 - 100  | SANITARY INVIABLE  |
| 35.1 - 80  | HIGH  | 
|  14.1 - 35 |  MIDDLE | 
|  5.1 - 14 |  LOW | 
| 0 - 5  | NO RISK  |

**The algorithms have to:**

- Read water body's to analyze
- Read and store name of each water body, number of IDs, municipality and classification IRCA (in one word, separate by space)
- Indicate the name of each water body and his municipality
- Indicate how many water body's have a risk level "HIGH" and "SANITARY INVIABLE"
- Indicate the name of municipality for the water body's have a risk level "HIGH" separate with space, in case of no one have this level print "NA"
- Indicate the high level risk between all water body's.
